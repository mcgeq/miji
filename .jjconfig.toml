# Jujutsu Project Configuration
# Using PowerShell-based formatting (no Python required)

# Recommended workflow:
# 1. Format changed files: bun run jj:c (runs jj-fmt.ps1)
# 2. Commit: jj commit -m "message"
# 
# Or use the batch script for both:
# .\jjc.bat -m "message"
#
# Note: jj aliases in Windows are tricky for multi-step commands.
# The batch script (jjc.bat) is the simplest and most reliable solution.
